# OCI Security Lists Management

This project provides a Streamlit application that helps manage security lists in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The application lists security lists with ingress rules and allows users to update those rules with their current public IP address.

## Features

- List security lists with ingress rule `0.0.0.0/0`.
- Update ingress rules with the current public IP.
- Download security lists as an Excel file.

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to set up your OCI configuration. Follow the steps below:

1. **OCI Config File**: Create a configuration file for your OCI account. You can use the following structure:

    key_file=/path/to/your/private/key.pem
    tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..your_tenancy_ocid
    region=us-ashburn-1
    ```
